=====*****Employers Looking for Entry Level Developers can compare candidates with similar experience*****=======
Let's face it, when you are looking for a junior dev, chances are they are just out of Bootcamp or Undergrad, and the resume is going to be light on experience. What you are looking for is a particular tech stack. With Code Cub, you can select from a database of new grads, based on skills, not job experience. Simply click on the skill to move it over to the stack, click SUBMIT STACK, and your candidates will pop up when you click FIND.
